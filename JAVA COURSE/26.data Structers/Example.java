/*  DATA STRUCTURES :-
 * 
 * 1).lets start by understanding data structure.data structure is a way of storing and organizing data in computers so that it can be used efficiently.
 * 2).To understanding the importance of data structures in programing,let's used efficiently.
 * 3).we will descuss these one by one in the upcoming slides.
 * 
 * DATA STRUCTURE TYPES :-
 * i).Array
 * ii).Linked list
 * iii)stack
 * iv).Queue
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * APPLICATIONS OF DATA STRUCTURES:-
 * i).Storing data in a table form.for example,contact details of a persion,which can be achived through arrays.
 * ii).music players and images slides use sliders use linkedlistto movie to next or previous items.
 * iii)documentation editiors and calculators use data structures.for example.when a user clicks on undo buttons.
 *     the last item added.must be removed first.
 * iv).A queue is used for scheduling tasks on ,first come firstservice basis.
 * v).Tree data structures is used by the descussion tree algorithem,which is widely used for machine learning and descussion making.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  CLASSIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURES :-
 * I).LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES
 * II).NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES
 * 
 * 
 * I).LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES :-
 * i).Array
 * ii).Linkedlist.
 * iii).stack
 * iv).queue
 * 
 * II).Non-leaner data structure:-
 *  i).tree
 * 
 * i)ARRAY AS DATA STRUCTURE :-
 *  -->hope you remember the array example given in previous topic.where a row of same type of glasses arranged on a tray.
 * --> some common operations that can be performed upon arrays are insertion,delition,searching,sorting.
