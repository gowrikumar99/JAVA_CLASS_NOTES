 * MULTITHEREADING IN JAVA :--
 * ===========================
 * 
 * i).multithereading in java is a process of excuting maltipul threading simultinuousily
 * ii).A thereading is a lightweight sub-processing,the smallest unit of processing
 * iii).it is a saparate path of excusion.
 * 
 * 
 *  LIFE CYCLE OF A THREAD(THREAD STATES):--
 * =========================================
 * 
 * i).the life cycle of the theread in java is controlled by JVM.
 * ii).the java theread states are as follows
 * 
 * 1).NEW :- the theread is in new statie if you create an instance of theread class but brfore the invitation of start() method.
 * 
 * 2).RUNNABLE :--the rennable is in runnable start after invocation of start() method.
 *    but the theread schedule has not selected
 * 
 * 3).RUNNING :- the running is in running state if the theread schedular has selected it.
 * 
 * 4).Non-Runnable(Blocked) :-- this is the state with the theread is still live,but is currently not eligible to run.
 * 
 * 5).A theread is in terminated or dead state when it's run() method exists.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  MALTITASKING :--
 * =================
 * I).Maltitasking is a process of executing multiple taskes simultaneousily
 * ii).we use multitasking to utilize the cpu multitasking can be achived in two ways.
